A Portuguese bank wants to use analytical solutions to support its new investments in Marketing campaigns, seeking greater efficiency in its operation and greater competitiveness in the market.

The goal is to develop a machine learning model to calculate the probability of a customer adhering to the company's product/service, and thus be able to better segment their campaigns to improve their results.

According to the company's strategy, the solution must be scalable and therefore based on cloud computing. So we will use Spark with AWS cloud tools in order to make the predictions faster and scalable.
